# Welcome to Orcs Must Read Unchained!
I created this small website to help my friends and I set up survival mode loadouts for [Project Rechained](https://github.com/TimeMaster18/Project-Rechained), a fan-made revival of Orcs Must Die! What began as a personal project ended up being useful to more people than I anticipated, so I'm now working on expanding the site for a broader audience. I hope it helps you get more familiar with the game and enhances your experience.

## Installing the game
To get started playing the game, follow the installation instructions on [Project Rechained's GitHub page](https://github.com/TimeMaster18/Project-Rechained).
