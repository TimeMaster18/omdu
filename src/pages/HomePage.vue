                        I created this small website to help my friends and I set up survival mode loadouts for <a href="https://github.com/TimeMaster18/Project-Rechained">Project Rechained</a>, a fan-made revival of Orcs Must Die! What began as a personal project ended up being useful to more people than I anticipated, so I'm now working on expanding the site for a broader audience. I hope it helps you get more familiar with the game and enhances your experience.
